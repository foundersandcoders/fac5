# Week 7: A Project Management app

This week, we are going to use GitHub to build an application to help us manage our workload.

Look at tools like:
+ [HuBoard](https://huboard.com/)
+ [Waffle](https://waffle.io/)
+ [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io/)

And take a look at [the GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/).

We are going to spend Monday morning coming up with ideas; we are going to break the task up into separate parts; we are going to wireframe it, design it, and develop it.

The aim is to have a working application by the end of the week that we can all use.

Start by doing some research. We will get our heads together at around 10.45.
