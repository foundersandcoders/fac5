# Week 6: Instagram

This week we are going to build a stripped-down version of [Instagram](https://instagram.com/), using [hapi](http://hapijs.com/).

The four key topics we are going to concentrate on are:
+ File upload
+ Authentication
+ Email alerting
+ Analytics

## Jigsaw Monday

Each of the role groups this week will take one of the four key topics and have all of Monday to work on it. Groups will present a tutorial on each of the topics, on successive mornings, starting with file uploads on Tuesday.

The tutorial should include a README and running and tested code. 

## hapi

At some point today, you are going to need to spend some time learning about [hapi](http://hapijs.com/). Our recommended starting point is [Learn hapi](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-hapi).

## Wednesday code reviews

This week we will down tools at 3pm on Wednesday to spend 90 minutes reviewing each others' code in pairs and raising issues. Each of the pairs will select a project they have not been working on and will present a 10-minute critique of it from 4.30pm onwards, using the issues they have raised as a starting point.
