The task for each group is to choose a database and research it. At the end of the day, you will present a GitHub repo on your chosen database.

Your README should contain the following:

### Why?
+ Why would you want to use this database?
+ What application areas is it suitable for?
+ Who else is using it?
+ What are they using it for?

### What?
+ What sort of database is it?
+ What other databases is it similar to?

### How?
+ How do you setup this database?
+ How do you use this database?
+ What Node.js modules are available for it?
+ Which one would you use, why, and how?

Create example code to demonstrate its use with a simple Node.js app.
