# Week 5: Add location-based services to your Twitter clone

This week, we are going to keep working on our Twitter clone to add location-based services.

### Step 1
+ Find out if your Web browser allows you to identify your current location on your phone or on your laptop. 

### Step 2
+ Add geolocation data to your posted tweets.

### Step 3
+ Experiment with posting tweets using your phone from different locations around Roman Road.

### Step 4
+ Use a mapping library, like [leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), to allow users to select a location on a map.

### Step 5
+ Add the selected location to your posted tweets as an alternative to getting it automatically from the current location.

### Step 6
+ Display posted tweets on a map.

### Step 7
+ Create a *near me* proximity search, which returns tweets posted within a given distance of a given (perhaps, your current) location.

### Step 8
+ Create an interesting use for your Twitter clone that involves the use of hashtags and proximity searching.

We are also going to spend some time this week getting more familiar with a range of databases and the morning challenges will be based around creating an object-relational mapper (ORM). By the end of the week (or maybe next week), you will be able to build an application with a database-agnostic ORM and use any one of a number of databases for your application without having to change your application code significantly.
