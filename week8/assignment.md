# Week 8: Scaling FAC / Virtualising the Course

Your mission, FAC5 - _should you chose to accept it_ -
is to _**use your creativity**_ to help _**scale**_
the Founders & Coders 8/16 Week Program.

You are free to consider any aspect of the FAC Program.
The main objective is to leverage the existing success
of the FAC Program and think of new ways to _share_ the learning experience
and friendships, knowledge you have acquired.


(_like last week_) We are going to spend Monday morning coming up with ideas;  
we are going to break the task(s) up into separate parts;
we are going to wireframe it, design it, and develop it.

The aim is to have a working application by the end of the week that we can all use.  
_However_ we should consider making it a good _foundation_ so that others can build upon it in the future.

## **Remember**:

> _you **know** how ... but if you **get stuck, ask**!_
> + [ ] **Documented**. Both READMEs and JSDoc: https://github.com/docdis/learn-jsdoc

## Research

Start by doing some research. We will get our heads together at around 10.45.

### What Can We Learn from _Existing_ "Solutions"?

+ [ ] What are the _Best **Existing**_ **V**irtual **L**earning **E**nvironments (**VLE**s)?
  + [ ] What makes them successful? is it UI/UX? First Mover Advantage? Sales+Marketing?
+ [ ] Which are the _most popular_ _**Open Source**_ **VLE**s?
+ [ ] What are they doing _badly_? (_where are the areas for improvment_?)

### What Can We Do Better?

Use your imagination, think of the pain points you had
while you were preparing for the FAC course (_pre-requisites_) ...

How can we simulate our successful group-based learning online?

**Note**: if anyone wants to continue working on this
over the summer,  
we [**@dwyl**](https://github.com/dwyl/alc) would like to support it:
