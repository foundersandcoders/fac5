# Week 4: build Twitter 

This week, you are going to build Twitter using Node.js.

This is not a small task and it is possible that we won't have time to do the whole of Twitter in a week, but we are going to give it our best shot. We are going to proceed in a series of small steps.

### Step 1 
+ Make Create, Read and Delete (CR-D) endpoints. 
+ Store your tweets as JSON in memory.

### Step 2
+ Store Tweets in the file system.

### Step 3 
+ Use Cookies to restrict tweet deletion to the browser from which the tweet was originally created. 

### Step 4 
+ Move your Tweets to Redis

### Step 5 
+ Deploy to Heroku

### Step 6 
+ Add real-time updates of tweets

Depending on how much progress you make, we may start adding some stretch steps before the end of the week.

You will be expected to use everything that you have learnt so far. You will be testing on both the front end back ends and you will have something approaching a full set of repo badges https://github.com/dwyl/repo-badges.

There will be a morning challenge each day 10-11.30am and we will be keeping it relevant.

We are likely to add a Jigsaw day on Tuesday. 

If you cannot solve a problem and nobody near you can help, please use the projector to share your problem.

Office hours this week will be at 4.30pm each day.
